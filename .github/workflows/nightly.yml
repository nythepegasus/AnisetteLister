              This is an ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** ⚠️ nightly build for commit [${{ github.sha }}](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/commit/${{ github.sha }}).
              
              Nightly builds are **extremely experimental builds only meant to be used by developers and alpha testers. They often contain bugs and experimental features. Use at your own risk!**
              
              If you want to try out new features early but want a lower chance of bugs, you can look at [SideStore Beta](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases?q=beta).
